# Challenge: Open Source Intelligence 7 : Sounds of freedom!
In a recent raid on a suspected COViD hideout, we found this video in a thumbdrive on-site. We are not sure what this video signifies but we suspect COViD's henchmen might be surveying a potential target site for a biological bomb. We believe that the attack may happen soon. We need your help to identify the water body in this video! This will be a starting point for us to do an area sweep of the vicinity!

## Summary

## Process

Upon opening the video, four things were identified:

1) The video was shot from a flat (Probably a condominium) that has dark gray supports

2) Theres is a bus stop below with a white roof, meaning its a newer one

3) The water body in the background which we have to identify, and

4) The HDB blocks in the background with a White-Cyan colour scheme

2 and 4 tells us this area has relatively new HDB blocks, which brings up areas such as Sengkang, Punggol and Tampines. From this, we had to find an area with a water body and a bus stop near these areas. Using Map view on Google Maps, we quickly identified Punggol Park, as it was a water body in a newer area. (Other water body we tried was Bedok Reservoir, but we did not find any similarities) There were 5 bus stops around the Park, which meant we quickly found the bus stop with a white roof as well as the Condo Block - Parkland Residences.

Since there were limited tries for this flag, we made very sure that this was the place, comparing Google Mapâ€™s street view (the blue lines) with the video and after confirming, inputted the postal code of Punggol Park which was 538768 into the Flag, which was correct.
