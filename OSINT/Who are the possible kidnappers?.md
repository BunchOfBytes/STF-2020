# Challenge: Who are the possible kidnappers?
Perform OSINT to gather information on the organisationâ€™s online presence. Start by identifying a related employee and obtain more information. Information are often posted online to build the organization's or the individual's online presence (i.e. blog post). Flag format is the name of the employee and the credentials, separated by an underscore. For example, the name is Tina Lee and the credentials is MyPassword is s3cure. The flag will be govtech-csg{TinaLee_MyPassword is s3cure}

Addendum:
- Look through the content! Have you looked through ALL the pages? If you believe that you have all the information required, take a step back and analyse what you have.
- In Red Team operations, it is common for Red Team operators to target the human element of an organisation. Social medias such as "Twitter" often have information which Red Team operators can use to pivot into the organisation. Also, there might be hidden portal(s) that can be discovered through "sitemap(s)"?

From the OSINT-1 the organisation we have organised is KoroVax, doing a simple Google search would lead us to their website, if we want to we can perform some Google Dorking magic
to reveal their website.
